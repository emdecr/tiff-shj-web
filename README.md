# SHJ Web Version

I donated and received their report, which was a PDF – https://assets.contentful.com/22n7d68fswlw/504ZaqAMKQE0gyogugACSM/4823126d05d5c7d59bffcdffabb848cd/Share_Her_Journey_-_The_Journey_So_Far.pdf?utm_source=TIFF&utm_campaign=c2e611ae9e-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2017_09_27&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_0073ebe7c0-c2e611ae9e-287018501&mc_cid=c2e611ae9e&mc_eid=82ae2228ff

I loved seeing the results, but thought others could benefit from it being delivered in a different format, so I sent the SHJ team a web mockup: https://settingup.space/tiff-shj

A couple things I added as feedback for the team:
* Based on the report's original copy I figured this wasn't supposed to be a widely-circulated doc – it directly thanks supporters.BUT non-donating folks should still see these results. Your team's doing incredible and important work. 
* A webpage is way more shareable than a PDF. It also adapts to different devices (i.e. responsive design – check it out on your tablets and phones). 
* Tasteful and deliberate animations are eye-catching, amusing, and informative. They can compliment and augment data (ex. The counter animation in the light blue 'social' section shows an increase in numbers and reinforces the 'so far' phrase).
* You can embed the tweets and IG posts, which could increase impression count because folks can click through the embeds. 
* There can be CTAs that folks can easily act upon (ex. The donate buttons at the bottom)
